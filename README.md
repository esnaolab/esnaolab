# About me

<!-- **esnaolab/esnaolab** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

I am interested in understanding the role of information in monitoring, communication, and decision making systems. My research lies broadly in:
* Information theory and data science  
* Machine learning and high-dimensional statistics
* Cybersecurity
  * Detection and mitigation of data integrity attacks  
  * Privacy and confidentiality
* Information processes on cyberphysical systems  
  * Robust estimation with imperfect information
  * Optimal sensor placement problems
